# Suggestions for Improvement

1. **Use `useContext` for State Management**

Leverage React's `useContext` hook for managing state across your application, providing a more efficient and centralized way to handle state compared to prop drilling.

2. **Enhance Testing**

Consider adding more tests and improving them by creating reusable functions and mocks.

3. **Enhance Code Readability**

Utilize JSDocs to improve code readability, making functions and their parameters clearer.

4. **Update Dependencies**

Keep packages updated to ensure security and compatibility with the latest features.

5. **End-to-End Testing**

Add end-to-end tests using frameworks like Playwright or Cypress to ensure full application functionality.

6. **Constants File**

Create a constants file to store commonly used variables, making them easily maintainable and accessible throughout the application.

7. **Linting and Formatting**

Set up linting and formatting tools like ESLint and Prettier to maintain a consistent code style throughout the project.

8. **Add TypeScript**

TypeScript gives us more certainty over the code we write and helps reduce the number of bugs and issues that are created.

# Features

1. ## Allow links to specific notes.

   With this feature, users can link directly to specific notes within your application. For instance, if you extract an ID from one note's link and paste it into the content of another note, you can easily create a hyperlink to the related note.

2. ## Implemented pagination on notes listing.

By implementing pagination on the notes listing, users can navigate through large sets of notes more efficiently.

3. ## Implemented favorite on notes.

  With the addition of the favoriteNotes feature, users can mark certain notes as favorites for quick access. 

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
